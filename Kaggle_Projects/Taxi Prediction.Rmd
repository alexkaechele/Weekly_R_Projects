# 1. Overview


A bit about taxis and what I've found out about with other kernals.

# 2. Data Formating

## 2.1 Setup

This is the step where data is imported and needed packages are loaded. A brief description of the function of each package is also included.

```{r DataSetup, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Loading Packages for Data Cleaning Sections
library(sqldf) # allows for preselection of values
library(data.table) # quick data manipulation / data reading
library(dplyr) # handy for data manipulation
library(plotly) # nice data viz package for interactive visualizations
library(ggplot2) # another nice data viz package
library(Amelia) # good way to explore data missingness
library(leaflet) # great mapping tool
# Loading Data
taxitrain <- as.data.table(read.csv.sql("C:/Users/AK055125/Documents/taxi_train.csv", 
                                        sql = "select * from file where `fare_amount` > 0 and passenger_count > 0 and passenger_count < 7", eol = "\n"))
taxitest <- as.data.table(fread("C:/Users/AK055125/Downloads/test.csv"))
taxitrain_small <- head(taxitrain, 10000) # more computationally friendly dataset to prototype some models

tr <- as.data.table(read.csv("C:/Users/AK055125/Documents/taxi_train.csv", header=TRUE, colClasses = c("key" = "character", "fare_amount" = "numeric", "pickup_datetime" = "POSIXct", "dropoff_longitude" = "numeric", "pickup_longitude" = "numeric", "dropoff_latitude" = "numeric", "pickup_latitude" = "numeric", "passenger_count" = "integer"), nrows = 22000000) %>% select(-key))

# might need to do this


```


## 2.2 Data Cleaning

Here missing/inconsistent data is dealt with. An example of inconsistent data is having negative ages or a person having a title "Miss" but marked as male. In addition, if there are columns that are the wrong data type (e.g. numeric data stored as a character), that would be dealt with here. 

Fortunately for us, the only data cleaning needed is handling the missing data in the age column. Since we are trying to predict external data that may have missing age data we will need to create a rule for imputation (since age is rather important in determining probability of surviving the Titanic). Fortunately there is some correlation between the titles and ages: "Master" is a term for a male child, those with "Miss" in their title have a lower average age than "Mrs," and those with "Officer" titles tend to be the oldest age group. Thus, we can impute missing ages by average ages of the different titles and get a better approximation for the missing ages than we would otherwise.


```{r DataCleaning, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

## Evaluating problems we'll have to deal with in the test data
missmap(taxitest) # Excellent no missingness problems

# Checking passenger count values
ggplot(taxitest, aes(x=passenger_count)) + 
  geom_density(color="darkblue", fill="lightblue") # Awsome maxes out at 6 which is reasonable

# Checking if there are values outside nyc
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng = taxitest$pickup_longitude, lat = taxitest$pickup_latitude) # dropoff shows similar values but leaflet starts to crash with that many observations


## Treating training data problems 
# Removing trips with no passengers

# Removing trips with more than 6 passengers

# Removing missing values

# Removing negative fares


```


## 2.3 Feature Engineering

Here we create additional variables that will be useful in our model. Some features I created include:

- Title dummies
- Family size
- Gender
- Embarked location.

```{r FeatureEngineering, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

```

## 2.4 Readying Data for Model Selection

Here we make a data frame of our numeric data, create a design matrix and specify our response. This formatting will be needed in our model selection process.

```{r ModelSelectionPrep, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# Subsetting Data to Numeric Features
list <- c("Survived", "Age", "Fare", "mr", "miss", "mrs", "master", "officer", "FamilySize", "Class1", "Class2", "Class3", "female", "Southampton", "Queenstown", "Cherbourg")
newdat <- subset(dat, select = list)

# Creating Target Variable and Design Matrix
x = model.matrix(Survived ~ ., data = newdat)
y = dat$Survived

```

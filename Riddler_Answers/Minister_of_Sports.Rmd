# Overview

**Rules/Assumptions**

- 16 teams play each other once (round robin format)
- Each team has a unique strength 16-1
- Schedule is random
- Season ends when one team is mathematically the winner
- Games are determined probabilistically 
    + Chance of winning numerator is the team's strength
    + Chance of losing numerator is the opposing team's strength
    + Chance of drawing is 1
    + The denominator for each is the sum of the two teams' strengths + 1
- A win is worth 2 pts, a draw 1 point, and a loss 0 pt

**Goal**

Create the fewest (median) games played.

**Actions**

After the first round (which all teams play simultaneously), we can pick the order of games played.

# Setting up the Data


Since we don't care who wins, just how many games it takes, let's create teams A-P with strengths in decending order (A with strength 16 and P with strength 1)

```{r , message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

for (j in 1:10){

# Making Initial Randomness Reproducable
set.seed(j)

# Loading Packages
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)

# Setting Number of Teams and Number of Rounds
n <- 16
teams <- LETTERS[1:n]
strengths <- n:1
r <- 15

# Setting up Possible Pairings and Team Strength
rounds <- list()
for(i in 1:r){
  round <- 
    data.table(
      round = i,
      team1 = teams[1:(n/2)],
      team2 = rev(teams)[1:(n/2)]#,
     # team1_strength = strengths[1:(n/2)],
     # team2_strength = rev(strengths)[1:(n/2)]
     )
      rounds[[i]] <- round
      teams <- c(teams[1], last(teams), head(teams[-1], -1))
}
rr <- bind_rows(rounds)

# Randomizing Order of Rounds
key <- data.table(round = 1:16,
                  real_round = sample(1:16, size = 16, replace = FALSE))
rr <- merge(rr, key, by = "round")
rr[ , round := NULL]

# Adding Winning Chances
# rr[ , team_1_expt_pts := 2*team1_strength/(1 + team1_strength + team2_strength) + 1/(1 + team1_strength + team2_strength) ]
# rr[ , team_2_expt_pts := 2*team2_strength/(1 + team1_strength + team2_strength) + 1/(1 + team1_strength + team2_strength) ]

# Probability of winning (and drawing)
rr[ , team1_win_prob := team1_strength/(1 + team1_strength + team2_strength)]
rr[ , team2_win_prob := team2_strength/(1 + team1_strength + team2_strength)]
rr[ , drawing := 1/(1 + team1_strength + team2_strength)]

print(rr)

}

```
